An app for a film rental store to manage their stock, made using React.

I created this as part of a course I took on codewithmosh.com. Throughout the course we would learn concepts, then gradually add functionality to the vidly app through a series of exercies. We then were shown his solutions, although I tried to comlete each exercise independently using my notes and web searches, usually only refactoring and tweaking syntax on seeing the solutions.

So even though this is just a 'training wheels' project, It showcases all the principles I learnt in the course, including:

- Composing class, stateless functional, and child components, including passing props, and using the state
- Handling events and lifecycle hooks
- Pagination, sorting, filtering and search bar
- Conditionaly rendering components, for example you can only see the delete button to delete movies if I make you an admin in the database
- Routing, including redirects and passing route parameters
- Creating forms, including validating fields using JOI
- Connecting to a node backend (provided in the course), which I linked to a database using MongoDB
- Using axios to inteact with API endpoints
- Managing users, storing information in the databse securely and verifying users using JWT's
- Deploying the app with Heroku
